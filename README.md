# HackerEarth-Adopt-a-Buddy
 HackerEarth Machine Learning Hackathon secured 55th rank over 5061 participants. 
 
“Adopt a buddy” - The brighter side of the pandemic is an increase in animal adoption and fostering.

This is my second Machine Learning HackerEarth Competition, in which I was able to secure 55th rank (top 1%) over 5061 participants. Though my first ML competition didn’t go well as I was placed in the top 10%, this is a promising improvement. I highly relied on feature engineering and that helped me to get better scores every time.
